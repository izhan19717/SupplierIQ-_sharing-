## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM - Manufacturing's $184M Blind Spot

### Mid-Market Manufacturers Are Flying Blind

**90% of companies experienced supply chain disruptions in 2024¹**

**The Hidden Crisis:**
- Average manufacturer loses **$184 million annually** from supplier disruptions²
- **43.6%** of disruptions caused by supplier failures specifically³
- Recovery takes an average of **2 weeks to plan and execute**⁴
- A single 30-day disruption costs **3-5% of annual EBITDA**⁵

**The Paradox:**
- **74% still rely on manual assessment processes**⁶
- Only **60% have visibility into tier-one suppliers**⁷
- Existing solutions cost **$100K+ annually** and take **6-12 months to implement**

**The Stakes:** For a $250M revenue manufacturer, supplier disruptions can wipe out **$7.5M-$12.5M in EBITDA** from a single month-long incident.

## SLIDE 3: THE PERFECT STORM - Why Now?

### Three Converging Forces Create Urgent Demand

**1. REGULATORY TSUNAMI**
- **EU CSDDD:** Mandatory supplier due diligence starting 2027, penalties up to **5% of global revenue**¹
- **UFLPA:** Intensified enforcement blocking imports without supplier traceability²
- **CSRD:** First ESG reports due 2025 requiring supply chain transparency³
- Currently only **9% of companies are compliant** with CSDDD⁴

**2. DISRUPTION ACCELERATION**
- **38% increase** in global supply chain disruptions in 2024⁵
- **22,522 disruption events** tracked globally in 2024 (up from 16,307 in 2023)⁶
- Labor disruptions surged **47% year-over-year**⁷
- Extreme weather incidents jumped **119%**⁸

**3. AI ADOPTION BREAKTHROUGH**
- **78% of organizations** now use AI in business operations (up from 55% in 2023)⁹
- **73% of companies** piloting AI in supply chain functions¹⁰
- **67% investing in Advanced Planning & Scheduling systems**¹¹
- But **only 10% have completed deployments** - solutions don't fit mid-market¹²

## SLIDE 18: RISKS & MITIGATION - What Could Go Wrong

### We've Thought Through the Challenges

**RISK 1: ENTERPRISE COMPETITORS ATTACK DOWN-MARKET**

**Risk:** Resilinc, Interos, or Everstream launch mid-market offerings at lower price points

**Likelihood:** Medium (2-3 year timeframe)
- Enterprise SaaS companies rarely successfully serve mid-market due to cost structure
- Sales teams and implementation models don't work at lower ACV
- Would require separate product, GTM, and team

**Mitigation:**
- **Speed:** Build customer base and brand before they react
- **Simplicity moat:** CSV upload and days-to-weeks deployment extremely hard to replicate in enterprise product architecture
- **Customer lock-in:** Historical data and risk baselines create switching costs
- **Move upmarket:** By Year 3, we can serve lower-end of enterprise ($500M-$1B revenue) and compete directly

---

**RISK 2: DATA QUALITY LIMITS PREDICTION ACCURACY**

**Risk:** Customers' supplier data is too incomplete or messy for accurate ML predictions

**Likelihood:** Medium-High (will affect 20-30% of prospects)

**Mitigation:**
- **Adaptive models:** Three model variants (full/core/minimal) handle varying data completeness
- **Gradual onboarding:** Start with available data, improve over time
- **Data quality scoring:** Show customers how completeness affects accuracy, incentivize better data
- **Fallback rules:** Rule-based predictions when ML confidence is low
- **Value beyond prediction:** Dashboard and monitoring still valuable even with limited predictive power

---

**RISK 3: CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COST EXCEEDS PROJECTIONS**

**Risk:** CAC of $7K-$10K instead of $5K target makes unit economics unworkable

**Likelihood:** Medium (Year 1-2 as we learn channels)

**Mitigation:**
- **Multiple channels:** Diversify across organic, paid, and partner channels
- **Product-led growth:** Freemium and self-service reduce sales burden
- **Efficient sales cycle:** 90-120 days vs. 180+ for competitors maintains velocity
- **Higher ACV:** Move to $70K-$80K average via upsells maintains LTV:CAC ratio
- **Pricing power:** Can increase prices 10-15% if needed (low churn risk given ROI)

---

**RISK 4: LONGER THAN EXPECTED SALES CYCLES**

**Risk:** 180-day cycles vs. 90-120 day target slows growth

**Likelihood:** Medium (especially without strong customer references)

**Mitigation:**
- **Free trials:** 30-day trials with their data show value immediately
- **ROI calculator:** Quantify savings upfront to accelerate business case
- **Case studies:** Early customer proof points shorten later sales cycles
- **Multi-threading:** Engage multiple stakeholders simultaneously
- **Channel partners:** ERP consultants reduce cycles by 25%

---

**RISK 5: HIGH CHURN DUE TO LACK OF IMMEDIATE VALUE**

**Risk:** Customers churn after 6-12 months if they don't see prevented disruptions

**Likelihood:** Low-Medium (depends on disruption frequency and communication)

**Mitigation:**
- **Strong onboarding:** Ensure customers see value in first 30 days
- **Proactive CS:** Regular business reviews showing value delivered
- **Predictive validation:** Track predictions that come true, showcase accuracy
- **Expand use cases:** Move beyond prediction to benchmarking, analytics, reporting
- **Annual contracts:** Lock in 12 months, reduce monthly churn risk

---

**RISK 6: TECHNICAL DEBT SLOWS PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT**

**Risk:** Rush to MVP creates fragile codebase that hampers new features

**Likelihood:** Medium (common in early-stage startups)

**Mitigation:**
- **Hire senior engineers:** Experience with scalable architecture from Day 1
- **Allocate refactoring time:** 20% of sprint capacity for tech debt reduction
- **Modular architecture:** Microservices approach enables parallel development
- **Automated testing:** 80%+ code coverage prevents regression
- **Technical co-founder:** CEO has hands-on technical background to guide decisions

## APPENDIX B: Customer Persona Deep Dive

### Target Customer: Mid-Market Manufacturing Procurement Director

**DEMOGRAPHICS:**
- **Title:** Director of Procurement, VP of Operations, Supply Chain Manager
- **Company Size:** $50M-$500M annual revenue

- **Team Size:** 2-3 person procurement team (or wearing multiple hats)
- **Age:** 40-55 years old
- **Experience:** 10-20 years in manufacturing/procurement

**PAIN POINTS:**
1. **Reactive firefighting:** Constantly surprised by supplier failures, scrambling to find alternatives
2. **Manual processes:** Managing 100-500 suppliers in spreadsheets, email, and tribal knowledge
3. **Limited resources:** No budget for $100K+ enterprise platforms or dedicated risk analysts
4. **Executive pressure:** CFO and CEO demanding better visibility and cost control
5. **Compliance burden:** New regulations (CSDDD, CSRD) requiring supplier due diligence without tools

**GOALS:**
1. **Predict problems:** Know which suppliers are at risk before disruptions hit production
2. **Justify decisions:** Data-driven supplier selection and risk mitigation
3. **Reduce costs:** Prevent expensive disruptions (expedited shipping, production delays)
4. **Sleep better:** Proactive vs. reactive supplier management
5. **Career advancement:** Position as strategic partner to leadership, not just order placer

**BUYING PROCESS:**
1. **Trigger:** Major supplier disruption costs company $200K+ and exposes lack of visibility
2. **Research:** Google search "supplier risk management software," reads industry publications
3. **Evaluation:** Demos 3-5 platforms, rules out enterprise solutions as too expensive/complex
4. **Business case:** Builds ROI model showing SupplierIQ pays for itself preventing 1 disruption/year
5. **Approval:** Gets CFO sign-off for <$100K software purchase (under approval threshold)
6. **Pilot:** 30-day trial with real supplier data convinces stakeholders
7. **Purchase:** Annual contract signed, onboarding completed in 2 weeks

**OBJECTIONS:**
- "We're too small for this kind of software" → Mid-market manufacturers face same supplier risks as enterprise
- "Our data is too messy" → Adaptive models work with whatever data you have, improves over time
- "We tried an ERP module and it didn't work" → Purpose-built for supplier risk vs. generic ERP module
- "How accurate are the predictions?" → Show case studies, validation metrics, free trial with their data
